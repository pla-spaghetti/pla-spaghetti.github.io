Put black electrical tape on the pi cam ribbon cable for protection and aesthetics. Think this is a better cam mount point but needs some modification or a different mount

Currently held on with a small clamp... I think a stationery cam is better for timlapses, and cam position could be changed to accommodate larger prints so that they fit in the frame
