# Eccentric nut adjustment
The x-gantry was dissassembled and reassembled after adjusting eccentric nuts.

gaps on 1st layer suggest z-offset too high

# Looking at GCODE
Did some GCODE investigation comparing CURA and PRUSA slicers. Note that there is no accounting for "paper width" offsets in either g-code. Both slicers allow such an offset to be set in z-offset which will translate all Z values in the output gcode. A better option is to account for the feeler guage width in the firmware z-offset calibration for BLTouch.


# Some sense on z-offset
[An article on z-offset calibration that makes sense and doesn't advise "paper-thickness" offsets](https://www.electronicsweekly.com/blogs/engineer-in-wonderland/3d-printing-accurate-heights-prototypes-2019-09/)


# Checking print height
a 20x20x20 cube, all layers 0.2mm

same settings as cube

4 layers should be 0.8mm

# Main board cover
This main board cover is nice since it lets us reuse a previous print that fits on the old cover (which no longer fits because of our BLTouch sensor);
