# Bed levelling after rebuild
starting point - it's clear something has changed

# Z-offset calibration
1. A feeler guage was placed under the nozzle.
2. The nozzle was moved toward it until friction felt between the feeler guage and nozzle.
3. The position was noted and this number plus the feeler thickness added to the firmware Z-offset.

The nozzle should now just touch the build surface when the Z coordinate is set to 0.0.


The first print looked squished.

a very flat underside

The process was repeated but with auto-bed-levelling enabled since it may be that we should recalibrate in reference to that.

first layer now looking good

good first layer so far

We bit of perimeter on layer 2 didn't stick, on the left. Turned temp up to 210, same as first layer, hope that's better.
